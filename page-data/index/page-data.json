I will always apply a critical mindset and ask unconventional questions to understand which problems are worth solving before jumping to solutions, to ensure I am delivering for my customers. I thrive in roles where I can help engineers and data scientists understand key business drivers and translate technical details to senior business leaders, acting as a bridge between organizations. In order to do this, as a servant leader, it is critical to demonstrate open communication and develop trust. Building trust among my team members requires setting clear and realistic expectations, defending their attention from unnecessary distractions, and enforcing accountability among all stakeholders.","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/brynamo","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brynamo/","projects":[{"name":"InferKnow","description":"Provide California's Emergency Coordinators with the Best Information to Quickly Save Lives and Property.","link":"https://github.com/brynamo/resume/blob/main/src/documents/inferknow.pdf"},{"name":"Yoda","description":"A privacy-preserving solution that facilitates virtual guided yoga practice.
